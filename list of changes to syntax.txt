NEW_TAG and NEW_CTAG removed, in favor for the already synonymous ADD_TAG and ADD_CTAG
This is arbitrary; the reason for me preferring ADD is that it "rhymes" better with REMOVE

creature variations removed
body detail plans not removed, but all except BP_POSITION and BP_RELATION are relegated to (creature) object variations
ADD_MATERIAL => USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE
ADD_TISSUE => USE_TISSUE_TEMPLATE
BP_LAYERS => kept, but transformed into repeated TISSUE_LAYER in a late step, as creatures sadly don't have BP_LAYERS
             This also means creatures can have it outside of templates
BP_RELSIZE => RELSIZE

the OT tokens that replace creature variations are applied instantly, instead of waiting for an
APPLY_(CURRENT_)CREATURE_VARIATION

the syntax for token conversion is different, instead of
[OT_CONVERT_TAG]
	[OTCT_MASTER:x]
	[OTCT_TARGET:y]
	[OTCT_REPLACEMENT:z]
[OT_CONVERT_TAG]
	[OTCT_MASTER:x]
	[OTCT_TARGET:u]
	[OTCT_REPLACEMENT:v]
it's 
[OT_CONVERT_TAG:x]
	[OTCT_TARGET:y]
		[OTCT_REPLACEMENT:z]
	[OTCT_TARGET:u]
		[OTCT_REPLACEMENT:v]

the replacement for APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION and BODY_DETAIL_PLAN is USE_OBJECT_TEMPLATE

These syntaxes currently exist:
APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION:template name:args
BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:template name:args
USE_TISSUE_TEMPLATE:new id:template name
USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:new id:template name (creatures and plants)
USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:template name        (inorganics)
